      "*   Eating a **massive** amount of seeds at once could theoretically cause minor intestinal discomfort or blockage, but this is extremely rare.\n",
      "*   The white, soft seeds in \"seedless\" watermelons are just empty seed coats and are even easier to digest.\n",

      "Fortune cookies, despite being strongly associated with Chinese restaurants in the West, actually originated in **Japan**, not China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a brief history:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Japanese Origins:** Their precursor is a Japanese cracker called ***tsujiura senbei*** (fortune cracker). These were larger, darker, and made with sesame and miso. They contained written fortunes (*omikuji*) and were sold at temples and by street vendors in Japan, especially in Kyoto, as early as the 19th century.\n",
      "*   **Introduction to the U.S.:** Japanese immigrants brought these treats to California in the late 19th or early 20th century. They were served in Japanese tea gardens and restaurants.\n",
      "*   **Shift During WWII:** During World War II, Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps. Chinese entrepreneurs saw an opportunity, adopted the cookie, and began mass-producing them with a more vanilla-flavored, lighter recipe. They started serving them in Chinese restaurants as a sweet end to meals.\n",
      "*   **Popularization:** After the war, fortune cookies became a staple in American Chinese restaurants and spread across the United States and later back to the Western world as a symbol of \"Chinese\" cuisine.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key takeaway:** While perfected and popularized by Chinese American entrepreneurs, the concept and original form of the fortune cookie came from Japan. They are virtually unknown in mainland China.\n",
      "Veins appear blue or greenish-blue due to a combination of how light interacts with your skin and blood, and how your brain perceives color. Here are the key reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Light Absorption and Scattering**\n",
      "- **Blood color:** Oxygen-rich blood in arteries is bright red. Oxygen-poor blood in veins is darker red (burgundy or purplish), not blue.\n",
      "- **Skin penetration:** Skin and tissue scatter and absorb different wavelengths of light. Red light (longer wavelength) penetrates deeper into tissue, while blue light (shorter wavelength) is mostly absorbed or scattered in the upper layers.\n",
      "- **What gets reflected:** Veins are located a few millimeters under the skin. When light hits your skin, the blue light tends to scatter back toward your eye from the skin surface, while the red light penetrates deeper. However, veins absorb more of the red light (because of the hemoglobin inside), so less red light is reflected back from the vein area compared to the surrounding tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Color Contrast**\n",
      "- The surrounding skin reflects both red and some blue light. Over a vein, there’s less red light reflected (because the vein absorbed it), so the area looks darker and shifted toward blue in comparison. This creates the illusion that the vein itself is blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Depth and Size of Veins**\n",
      "- Deeper veins may not be visible at all. The veins you see are close enough to the surface for this light interaction to happen but deep enough that the blood color is altered by overlying tissue.\n",
      "- Thinner veins might appear more blue, while larger, deeper veins can look greenish because of additional light scattering through multiple tissue layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Perception and Brain Interpretation**\n",
      "- Your brain also plays a role. The color you perceive is influenced by contrast with surrounding skin tones. For example, veins might look different on pale skin versus darker skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Important Clarification:**\n",
      "If you’ve ever seen blood drawn or a cut vein, the blood is **dark red**, not blue. This confirms that the blue appearance is an optical effect, not the actual color of the blood inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, veins look blue because of how light travels through your skin and how colors are absorbed/reflected by blood and tissue—not because the blood itself is blue.\n",
      "The spiciest part of a chili pepper is typically the **placenta** — the white, pithy membrane inside the pepper to which the seeds are attached.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While the seeds themselves are often spicy, it’s because they are in direct contact with the placenta, which contains the highest concentration of **capsaicin**, the compound responsible for the heat.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you want to reduce spiciness in a dish, removing the placenta and seeds will help significantly.\n",
      "In the United States, there is **no mandatory waiting period** to report someone missing. This is a common myth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important advice is: **If you are genuinely concerned for someone's safety and well-being, you should file a report immediately.**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Trust Your Instincts:** If the disappearance is out of character, if the person is vulnerable (a child, elderly, has a medical or mental health condition), or if you suspect foul play, **do not wait. Contact law enforcement right away.**\n",
      "2.  **For Children and Vulnerable Adults:** Law enforcement agencies typically act immediately on reports involving minors, individuals with disabilities, or the elderly.\n",
      "3.  **For Adults:** While agencies have discretion, they will generally take the report and begin an assessment. The first 48 hours are often critical in missing person cases.\n",
      "4.  **What to Do Before Calling:**\n",
      "    *   Quickly check with the person's friends, family, and workplace.\n",
      "    *   Try calling their phone.\n",
      "    *   Check their home if possible.\n",
      "    *   Gather recent photos, a detailed physical description, and information on what they were last wearing and where they were last seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to File a Report:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Call the local police department's non-emergency number** for the area where the person was last seen or lives. In an immediate emergency or if there is clear danger, call **911**.\n",
      "*   Be prepared to provide all the details you have gathered.\n",
      "*   Request a **National Crime Information Center (NCIC) entry** to ensure the missing person is entered into the national database.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bottom Line: Do not let the myth of a 24 or 48-hour waiting period delay you. Early reporting greatly increases the chances of a safe recovery.**\n"
